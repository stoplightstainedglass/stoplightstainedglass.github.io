		<p>I started my stained glass journey around 5 years ago. One evening, while my now, mother-in-law was working on some glass herself and I mentioned I had always had an interest in making stained glass, and of course how beautiful it was. I explained to her how my uncle and great-aunt use to do it, but unfortunately both had both passed by the time my interest had peaked. She said she would happily teach me and off we went!</p>
		<p>Stained glass is a true art and I was unaware of how much time it took. Learning the practices, precision and reward has all taken an outrageous amount of time and patience.</p>
		<p>Here we are 5 years later and I would not change it for anything. I have learned so much and developed my craft. I do a wide range of items, the smallest of being pendants and necklaces and the largest thus being a custom panel for a bathroom.</p>
		<p>What started as pure fun, soon showed the chance of also becoming an income. I've started attending numerous festivals and events selling my pieces all over the tri-state area.
		For me this has always been a family affair. My wife helps me with patterns and layouts, my parents, grandmother, and in-laws help me at shows and my brother is my tech support.</p>
